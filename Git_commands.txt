Useful git commands:

Step 1: (While still on your own branch <myBranch>, stage and commit changes.)
git add -A (or <path/filenames> separated by spaces)
git commit -m "Message"

Step 2: (Resolve conflicts, repeat until no new conflicts arise.)
git pull origin master
git add -A
git commit -m "merged conflicts"

Step 3: (Merge changes onto master and push.)
git push origin <myBranch>
git checkout master
git merge <myBranch>
git push origin master
(You may need to repeat step 2 again if someone else has coincidentally pushed right before you.)

Step 4: (Return to <myBranch>.)
git checkout <myBranch>
(The two commands below are only necessary if you ran into conflicts during the last step.)
git merge master (There should not be any new conflicts.)
git push origin <myBranch>
